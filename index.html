I swear to god I‚Äôm trying I‚Äôm trying so hard not to focus on us but to focus on ourselves for this little while and pretend like it‚Äôs all okay but the thought is just too much. Wallah idk what‚Äôs going on w me, all my life I‚Äôve never experienced the feelings that I experienced talking to you all my life I‚Äôve never experienced the emotional rollercoaster and the variety of feelings that come with loving someone and I can‚Äôt get you out of my head I swear it sounds corny but every single thing I did for the past 4 years had you written all over it. The school hoodie I wear at home, is the one you love, when I go outside I take my wallet, inside it is the gift card that I bought for you as a temporary gift, on my bedside I have a pink bunny the one I promised to save for you and on the frickin bunny is your pencil just sitting right there. I don‚Äôt know what it is I don‚Äôt know what to do and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm going to send this to you but it sucks so bad and I just want to talk to you man I just wanna talk about anything at all doesn‚Äôt have to be related to anything but I just want you in my life. Over the past 4 years you‚Äôve been my rock too, you‚Äôve been the one that I‚Äôd go to for everything the person I‚Äôd talk to for every single thing express my love express my frustrations and idk how to let go I can‚Äôt I just can‚Äôt.

                            HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYYYYY LOSERRR, I have not written one of these in a minute but I would like to wish u a very frickin happy birthday!!!! I know that right now you are going through a lot but InshaAllah with due time things will be much better for you. The world is a cruel place but with people like you in it, it makes it this much better. I think about you every single day and I pray that you feel at peace with everything despite everything that's going on. Sometimes I take you for granted but I honestly can't live my life without you. You're my favourite -- no scratch that, you are MY PERSON and you always will be no matter how little we talk or interact every day. I don't usually put 110% effort when it comes to things but with you I always try my absolute best to keep you at peace and at comfort. I pray that things work out (please please). Our time apart just feels like an eternity, and every passing day only deepened the ache in my soul. Yet, in the midst of the longing, I held on to the memories we shared, it's almost like a treasure that keeps me going and my spirit alive. I will always cherish the lessons we're learning during our time apart, for they have shown us the value of what we have. We have grown, we have yearned, and we have discovered that inner peace is the best remedy for all of our problems. I also lied the other day when I said I don't want to be dependent because trust me there's nothing more in this world, I'd want other than to share things with you but I will save it for when the time is right InshaAllah. I hope you have a good day and I hope this message makes your day just a tad bit better.



(PS: Sometimes saying a phrase doesn't do it justice, so I won't end with it, but I hope this makes it clear for you that it's always true, and always will be ml)
